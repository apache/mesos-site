    <h1>Mesos Fetcher</h1>

<p>Mesos 0.23.0 introduced experimental support for the Mesos <em>fetcher cache</em>.</p>

<p>In this context we loosely regard the term &ldquo;downloading&rdquo; as to include copying
from local file systems.</p>

<h2>What is the Mesos fetcher?</h2>

<p>The Mesos fetcher is a mechanism to download resources into the <a href="/documentation/latest/./sandbox/">sandbox
directory</a> of a task in preparation of running
the task. As part of a TaskInfo message, the framework ordering the task&rsquo;s
execution provides a list of <code>CommandInfo::URI</code> protobuf values, which becomes
the input to the Mesos fetcher.</p>

<p>The Mesos fetcher can copy files from a local filesytem and it also natively
supports the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS protocols. If the requested URI is based
on some other protocol, then the fetcher tries to utilise a local Hadoop client
and hence supports any protocol supported by the Hadoop client, e.g., HDFS, S3.
See the agent <a href="/documentation/latest/./configuration/agent/">configuration documentation</a>
for how to configure the agent with a path to the Hadoop client.</p>

<p>By default, each requested URI is downloaded directly into the sandbox directory
and repeated requests for the same URI leads to downloading another copy of the
same resource. Alternatively, the fetcher can be instructed to cache URI
downloads in a dedicated directory for reuse by subsequent downloads.</p>

<p>The Mesos fetcher mechanism comprises of these two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The agent-internal Fetcher Process (in terms of libprocess) that controls and
coordinates all fetch actions. Every agent instance has exactly one internal
fetcher instance that is used by every kind of containerizer.</p></li>
<li><p>The external program <code>mesos-fetcher</code> that is invoked by the former. It
performs all network and disk operations except file deletions and file size
queries for cache-internal bookkeeping. It is run as an external OS process in
order to shield the agent process from I/O-related hazards. It takes
instructions in form of an environment variable containing a JSON object with
detailed fetch action descriptions.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>The fetch procedure</h2>

<p>Frameworks launch tasks by calling the scheduler driver method <code>launchTasks()</code>,
passing <code>CommandInfo</code> protobuf structures as arguments. This type of structure
specifies (among other things) a command and a list of URIs that need to be
&ldquo;fetched&rdquo; into the sandbox directory on the agent node as a precondition for
task execution. Hence, when the agent receives a request to launch a task, it
calls upon its fetcher, first, to provision the specified resources into the
sandbox directory. If fetching fails, the task is not started and the reported
task status is <code>TASK_FAILED</code>.</p>

<p>All URIs requested for a given task are fetched sequentially in a single
invocation of mesos-fetcher. Here, avoiding download concurrency reduces the
risk of bandwidth issues somewhat. However, multiple fetch operations can be
active concurrently due to multiple task launch requests.</p>

<h3>The URI protobuf structure</h3>

<p>Before mesos-fetcher is started, the specific fetch actions to be performed for
each URI are determined based on the following protobuf structure. (See
<code>include/mesos/mesos.proto</code> for more details.)</p>

<pre><code>message CommandInfo {
  message URI {
    required string value = 1;
    optional bool executable = 2;
    optional bool extract = 3 [default = true];
    optional bool cache = 4;
    optional string output_file = 5;
  }
  ...
  optional string user = 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The field &ldquo;value&rdquo; contains the URI.</p>

<p>If the &ldquo;executable&rdquo; field is &ldquo;true&rdquo;, the &ldquo;extract&rdquo; field is ignored and
has no effect.</p>

<p>If the &ldquo;cache&rdquo; field is true, the fetcher cache is to be used for the URI.</p>

<p>If the &ldquo;output_file&rdquo; field is set, the fetcher will use that name for the copy
stored in the sandbox directory. &ldquo;output_file&rdquo; may contain a directory
component, in which case the path described must be a relative path.</p>

<h3>Specifying a user name</h3>

<p>The framework may pass along a user name that becomes a fetch parameter. This
causes its executors and tasks to run under a specific user. However, if the
&ldquo;user&rdquo; field in the CommandInfo structure is specified, it takes precedence for
the affected task.</p>

<p>If a user name is specified either way, the fetcher first validates that it is
in fact a valid user name on the agent. If it is not, fetching fails right here.
Otherwise, the sandbox directory is assigned to the specified user as owner
(using <code>chown</code>) at the end of the fetch procedure, before task execution begins.</p>

<p>The user name in play has an important effect on caching.  Caching is managed on
a per-user base, i.e. the combination of user name and &ldquo;uri&rdquo; uniquely
identifies a cacheable fetch result. If no user name has been specified, this
counts for the cache as a separate user, too. Thus cache files for each valid
user are segregated from all others, including those without a specified user.</p>

<p>This means that the exact same URI will be downloaded and cached multiple times
if different users are indicated.</p>

<h3>Executable fetch results</h3>

<p>By default, fetched files are not executable.</p>

<p>If the field &ldquo;executable&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;true&rdquo;, the fetch result will be changed to
be executable (by &ldquo;chmod&rdquo;) for every user. This happens at the end of the fetch
procedure, in the sandbox directory only. It does not affect any cache file.</p>

<h3>Archive extraction</h3>

<p>If the &ldquo;extract&rdquo; field is &ldquo;true&rdquo;, which is the default, then files with
a recognized extension that hints at packed or compressed archives are unpacked
in the sandbox directory. These file extensions are recognized:</p>

<ul>
<li>.tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz</li>
<li>.gz, .tgz, .tbz2, .txz, .zip</li>
</ul>


<p>In case the cache is bypassed, both the archive and the unpacked results will be
found together in the sandbox. In case a cache file is unpacked, only the
extraction result will be found in the sandbox.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;output_file&rdquo; field is useful here for cases where the URI ends with query
parameters, since these will otherwise end up in the file copied to the sandbox
and will subsequently fail to be recognized as archives.</p>

<h3>Bypassing the cache</h3>

<p>By default, the URI field &ldquo;cache&rdquo; is not present. If this is the case or its
value is &ldquo;false&rdquo; the fetcher downloads directly into the sandbox directory.</p>

<p>The same also happens dynamically as a fallback strategy if anything goes wrong
when preparing a fetch operation that involves the cache. In this case, a
warning message is logged. Possible fallback conditions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server offering the URI does not respond or reports an error.</li>
<li>The URI&rsquo;s download size could not be determined.</li>
<li>There is not enough space in the cache, even after attempting to evict files.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fetching through the cache</h3>

<p>If the URI&rsquo;s &ldquo;cache&rdquo; field has the value &ldquo;true&rdquo;, then the fetcher cache is in
effect. If a URI is encountered for the first time (for the same user), it is
first downloaded into the cache, then copied to the sandbox directory from
there. If the same URI is encountered again, and a corresponding cache file is
resident in the cache or still en route into the cache, then downloading is
omitted and the fetcher proceeds directly to copying from the cache. Competing
requests for the same URI simply wait upon completion of the first request that
occurs. Thus every URI is downloaded at most once (per user) as long as it is
cached.</p>

<p>Every cache file stays resident for an unspecified amount of time and can be
removed at the fetcher&rsquo;s discretion at any moment, except while it is in direct
use:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is still being downloaded by this fetch procedure.</li>
<li>It is still being downloaded by a concurrent fetch procedure for a different
task.</li>
<li>It is being copied or extracted from the cache.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once a cache file has been removed, the related URI will thereafter be treated
as described above for the first encounter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to refresh a cache entry in the current
experimental version of the fetcher cache. A future feature may force updates
based on checksum queries to the URI.</p>

<p>Recommended practice for now:</p>

<p>The framework should start using a fresh unique URI whenever the resource&rsquo;s
content has changed.</p>

<h3>Determining resource sizes</h3>

<p>Before downloading a resource to the cache, the fetcher first determines the
size of the expected resource. It uses these methods depending on the nature of
the URI.</p>

<ul>
<li>Local file sizes are probed with systems calls (that follow symbolic links).</li>
<li>HTTP/HTTPS URIs are queried for the &ldquo;content-length&rdquo; field in the header. This
is performed by <code>curl</code>. The reported asset size must be greater than zero or
the URI is deemed invalid.</li>
<li>FTP/FTPS is not supported at the time of writing.</li>
<li>Everything else is queried by the local HDFS client.</li>
</ul>


<p>If any of this reports an error, the fetcher then falls back on bypassing the
cache as described above.</p>

<p>WARNING: Only URIs for which download sizes can be queried up front and for
which accurate sizes are reported reliably are eligible for any fetcher cache
involvement. If actual cache file sizes exceed the physical capacity of the
cache directory in any way, all further agent behavior is completely
unspecified. Do not use any cache feature with any URI for which you have any
doubts!</p>

<p>To mitigate this problem, cache files that have been found to be larger than
expected are deleted immediately after downloading and delivering the
requested content to the sandbox. Thus exceeding total capacity at least
does not accumulate over subsequent fetcher runs.</p>

<p>If you know for sure that size aberrations are within certain limits you can
specify a cache directory size that is sufficiently smaller than your actual
physical volume and fetching should work.</p>

<p>In case of cache files that are smaller then expected, the cache will
dynamically adjust its own bookkeeping according to actual sizes.</p>

<h3>Cache eviction</h3>

<p>After determining the prospective size of a cache file and before downloading
it, the cache attempts to ensure that at least as much space as is needed for
this file is available and can be written into. If this is immediately the case,
the requested amount of space is simply marked as reserved. Otherwise, missing
space is freed up by &ldquo;cache eviction&rdquo;. This means that the cache removes files
at its own discretion until the given space target is met or exceeded.</p>

<p>The eviction process fails if too many files are in use and therefore not
evictable or if the cache is simply too small. Either way, the fetcher then
falls back on bypassing the cache for the given URI as described above.</p>

<p>If multiple evictions happen concurrently, each of them is pursuing its own
separate space goals. However, leftover freed up space from one effort is
automatically awarded to others.</p>

<h2>HTTP and SOCKS proxy settings</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to use a proxy to download the file. The Mesos
fetcher uses libcurl internally for downloading content from
HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS servers, and libcurl can use a proxy automatically if
certain environment variables are set.</p>

<p>The respective environment variable name is <code>[protocol]_proxy</code>, where
<code>protocol</code> can be one of socks4, socks5, http, https.</p>

<p>For example, the value of the <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable would be used
as the proxy for fetching http contents, while <code>https_proxy</code> would be used for
fetching https contents. Pay attention that these variable names must be
entirely in lower case.</p>

<p>The value of the proxy variable is of the format
<code>[protocol://][user:password@]machine[:port]</code>, where <code>protocol</code> can be one of
socks4, socks5, http, https.</p>

<p>FTP/FTPS requests with a proxy also make use of an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Even
though in general this constrains the available FTP protocol operations,
everything the fetcher uses is supported.</p>

<p>Your proxy settings can be placed in <code>/etc/default/mesos-slave</code>. Here is an
example:</p>

<pre><code>export http_proxy=https://proxy.example.com:3128
export https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com:3128
</code></pre>

<p>The fetcher will pick up these environment variable settings since the utility
program <code>mesos-fetcher</code> which it employs is a child of mesos-agent.</p>

<p>For more details, please check the
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html">libcurl manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Agent flags</h2>

<p>It is highly recommended to set these flags explicitly to values other than
their defaults or to not use the fetcher cache in production.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;fetcher_cache_size&rdquo;, default value: enough for testing.</li>
<li>&ldquo;fetcher_cache_dir&rdquo;, default value: somewhere inside the directory specified
by the &ldquo;work_dir&rdquo; flag, which is OK for testing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Recommended practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a separate volume as fetcher cache. Do not specify a directory as fetcher
cache directory that competes with any other contributor for the underlying
volume&rsquo;s space.</li>
<li>Set the cache directory size flag of the agent to less than your actual cache
volume&rsquo;s physical size. Use a safety margin, especially if you do not know
for sure if all frameworks are going to be compliant.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ultimate remedy:</p>

<p>You can disable the fetcher cache entirely on each agent by setting its
&ldquo;fetcher_cache_size&rdquo; flag to zero bytes.</p>

<h2>Future Features</h2>

<p>The following features would be relatively easy to implement additionally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Perform cache updates based on resource check sums. For example, query the md5
field in HTTP headers to determine when a resource at a URL has changed.</li>
<li>Respect HTTP cache-control directives.</li>
<li>Enable caching for ftp/ftps.</li>
<li>Use symbolic links or bind mounts to project cached resources into the
sandbox, read-only.</li>
<li>Have a choice whether to copy the extracted archive into the sandbox.</li>
<li>Have a choice whether to delete the archive after extraction bypassing the
cache.</li>
<li>Make the segregation of cache files by user optional.</li>
<li>Extract content while downloading when bypassing the cache.</li>
<li>Prefetch resources for subsequent tasks. This can happen concurrently with
running the present task, right after fetching its own resources.</li>
</ul>
